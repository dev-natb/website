# TODO: dockerize
1. Make image - base python image

1.1 SQLite db in container
1.2 SQLlite db mounted as volume

2. Publish image (1.1) to ECR

3. Run on lambda using container image
3.1 Validate lambda works by validating ugly URL success

# http://byrgiot.is/
4. Configure public lambda to use personal domain (Route 53)

Need to run docker build and deploy after each new post.

5. Deploy with new blog post

6. Refactor lambda to use databaseless image (1.2)
6.1 DB file on EFS volume
6.2 Lambda use EFS and mounted correctly
6.3 Validate new blog post persists after 5 min

7. Investigate Write-Ahead Logging and decide on turning on
